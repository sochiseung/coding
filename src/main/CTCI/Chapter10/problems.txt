10.1 You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play 1 of 2 games.
Game #1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
Game #2: You get three shots and you have to make 2 of 3 shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?


10.2 There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle?
Similarly find the probability of collision with ‘n’ ants on an ‘n’ vertex polygon.


10.3 Given two lines on a Cartesian plane, determine whether the two lines would intersect.


10.4 Write a method to implement *, - , / operations. You should use only the + operator.


10.5 Given two squares on a two dimensional plane, find a line that would cut these two squares in half.


10.6 Given a two dimensional graph with points on it, find a line which passes the most number of points.


10.7 Design an algorithm to find the kth number such that the only prime factors are 3, 5, and 7.
