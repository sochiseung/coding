7.1 Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you would subclass it to implement particular card games.


7.2 Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: fresher, technical lead (TL), product manager (PM). There can be multiple employees, but only one TL or PM. An incoming telephone call must be allocated to a fresher who is free. If a fresher can’t handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to technical lead. If the TL is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to PM. Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method getCallHandler().


7.3 Design a musical juke box using object oriented principles.


7.4 Design a chess game using object oriented principles.


7.5 Design the data structures for an online book reader system.


7.6 Implement a jigsaw puzzle. Design the data structures and explain an algorithm to solve the puzzle.


7.7 Explain how you would design a chat server. In particular, provide details about the various backend components, classes, and methods. What would be the hardest problems to solve?


7.8 Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the other. When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both the left and right sides, or both the top and bottom, it is said to be captured and its color is flipped. On your turn, you must capture at least one of your opponent’s pieces. The game ends when either user has no more valid moves, and the win is assigned to the person with the most pieces. Implement the object oriented design for Othello.


7.9 Explain the data structures and algorithms that you would use to design an in-memory file system. Illustrate with an example in code where possible.


7.10 Describe the data structures and algorithms that you would use to implement a garbage collector in C++.
