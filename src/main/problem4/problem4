[Trees and Graphs]
problem 4-1
    Implement a function to check if a tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that no two leaf nodes differ in distance from the root by more than one.

[Bit Manipulation]
problem 4-2
    You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M (e.g., M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j).
    EXAMPLE:
    Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10101, i = 2, j = 6
    Output: N = 10001010100
